# ScheduleHack-

This is a web-based application which allows users (students, in this case) to generate a multi-year course sequence. The resulting sequence is tailored according to the preferences and academic record inputted by the users, such as having or not classes at certain days of the week or during the mornings or the evenings, all this while conforming to the rules set forth in the Undergraduate Calendar. 

There are two classes of users, students with a read-only privilege and staff who have a read/write privilege.
